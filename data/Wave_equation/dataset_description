The wave equation, which is a commonly-used PDE to describe the vibration and fluctuation phenomenon, is written as:
utt-uxx=0
The dataset is grid data of 161 spatial observation points in the domain [0,pi] and 321 temporal observation points in the domain [0,2pi], and thus the data size is 51,681.
