The Burgers equation, which has a wide application in many fields, including fluid mechanics, nonlinear acoustics, gas dynamics and traffic flow, is written as:
ut+uux-0.1uxx=0  
The dataset is grid data of 256 spatial observation points in the domain (-8.8) and 201 temporal observation points in the domain [0,10], and thus the data size is 51,456.
