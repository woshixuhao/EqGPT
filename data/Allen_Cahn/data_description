The Allen-Chan equation, which is a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation that describes the phase separation of multi-component metal alloys[32], is written as:  
ut-0.003uxx-u+u^3=0	
The dataset is grid data of 256 spatial observation points in the domain x in (-1,1) and 201 temporal observation points in the domain t in (0,10], and thus the data size is 51,456.
